🧪 IT Home Labs

Welcome to my personal lab portfolio, where I document my IT labs related to systems administration, networking, cloud, and cybersecurity. Each folder contains step-by-step walkthroughs, screenshots, and lessons learned from real-world simulations.

🧠 Purpose of This Repo

This repo is a growing portfolio to:
* Build and showcase practical IT skills
* Document what I learn as I move through my career path
* Demonstrate troubleshooting, scripting, and configuration abilities
* Help others learning the same path find real-world examples
